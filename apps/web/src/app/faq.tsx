    desc: "It really matters and then like it really doesn't matter. What matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like offended by it, it doesn't matter. Because it's about motivating the doers. Because I'm here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too. We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're constantly growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don't appreciate the moment until it's passed.",

But the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you believe in what you believe in, if you were the only one who believed it? If everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually succeeds - just the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration. People are so scared to lose that they don't even try.

If you're taught you can't do anything, you won't do anything. I was taught I could do everything.

That's what I do. That's what I'm here for. Don't be afraid to be wrong because you can't learn anything from a compliment. I always felt like I could do anything.
